          A warm thanks to the Tap Academy team.<br>
           I am Gowtham GM from Tamilnadu, a 2024 passed-out <br>student. I joined Tap Academy as a CSR student in the month <br>of February. My journey with Tap Academy 
           is quite different.<br> The trainers at Tap Academy 
           are skilled and experienced.<br> They teach a lot of 
           new concepts and help in learning programming languages
            from scratch.<br><br>
      
          I am from the Computer Science branch, but the teaching at <br>
          Tap Academy is structured in a way that makes it easy for<br>
           students from all domains to understand the concepts and<br>
            technology taught by the trainers.<br><br>
      
      Finally, I got placed as a Software Engineer at Revature with a<br>
       package of 3.25 LPA. The placement team helped me a lot in <br>
       securing this job.<br><br>
      
      Thank you to the entire Tap Academy team for helping me acquire this opportunity.

          After joining Tap Academy, I have improved my programming<br>
           skills, and my knowledge of core Java has also improved.<br>
            Now, I am learning the Collection Framework, MySQL, HTML,<br>
             and CSS in parallel.<br><br>
      
      Through the TAI platform, I have enhanced my problem-<br>
      solving skills. Additionally, the LMS makes it easy to watch all <br>
      the recorded videos. They also provide recorded videos of<br>
       frameworks like J2EE, Spring, Data Structures, etc.<br><br>
      
      I got placed in Promantia Business Solutions for the role of <br>
      Associate Technical Consultant with a package of 3 LPA.<br>
      
      Thank you TAP ACADEMY for giving me this opportunity.

      I'm a student from the Feb 2 batch, and I'm happy to share my<br>
       experience with Tap Academy. They visited our college in<br>
       Tamil Nadu and selected students for their CSR batch,<br>
     offering a free course that's been incredibly helpful. <br>
    Compared to other academies, Tap Academy stands out for<br>
  its excellent trainers, who explain complex concepts in a<br>
   clear and concise manner, start from scratch, making it easy for<br>
  beginners to understand, and provide in-depth coverage of<br>
  programming and OOPS concepts, highly valuable for<br>
   placement opportunities. I'm grateful to have been selected<br>
   by Avasoft with the role of Trainee Engineer with a package of<br>
  5 LPA through college placement, and I attribute my success<br>
   to Tap Academy's incredible teaching, as I used the same<br>
   approach they taught me during them mock interview process.<br>
   Additionally, Tap Academy offers comprehensive<br>
   notebooks and study materials, an LMS platform with daily<br>
   programming questions, weekly assessments, and monthly<br>
    mock assessments and Interviews, boosting placement<br>
     confidence, as well as soft skill classes focusing on logical<br>
      thinking.
